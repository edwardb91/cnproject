                <h1> Typesetting </h1>
                <p> I am Adobe Certified in Page Layout and Visual Design using Adobe InDesign and Photoshop. Following from this qualification, I have continued to develop my skills in typesetting and have worked as a typesetter for two publications.

                <h2>Interscript</h2>
                   <p>During my MA in Publishing at UCL I undertook a voluntary position as the typesetter for the academic journal Interscript. I was responsible for creating the template for all articles, as well as producing the final PDF files for publication. The articles that I worked on directly can be found <a href= https://student-journals.ucl.ac.uk/int/issue/31/info>here</a>. The template I produce for the journal is still in use for all current issues.
