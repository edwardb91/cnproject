                <h1>Editing</h1>
                <p> Over the course of my career in Publishing I have demonstrated myself to be an accurate and efficient editor, copywriter, and proofreader. I have worked on a range of written content, including professional business publications, academic journal articles and PhD theses, a variety of fiction and non-fiction prose, and poetry. I have extensive in-house experience with professional publishers and have also worked on many freelance projects with multiple clients. I am available for any freelance editing and proofreading opportunities across any kind of content. Below is a list previously published work that I have been involved with.</p>

                    <h2>Professional Publications</h2>
                    <p>During my tenure at the ARK Group, and working with the publishers contained underneath the parent company Wilmington PLC, I had the pleasure of working on a number of high-quality titles aimed at the business, legal, and third sector markets. This was an amazing opportunity to working with some of the leading minds of their industries, and to bring their vast knowledge of their respected sectors to an engaged audience. Whilst working on these titles I performed a wide array of tasks, including developmental editing on original manuscripts and proofreading print-ready proofs.</p>

                    <h2>Square Wheel Press</h2>
                    <p>In 2020 I launched my own independent digital press to pursue my passions for creative writing and literary publishing. Square Wheel Press publishes free digital anthologies of author's writings on a selected theme; containing poetry, short fiction, and non-fiction. As Editor-in-Chief, I oversee all stages of publishing process and undertake editing and proofreading responsibilities along with our other editor. I am also the typesetter for the anthologies, bringing our author's amazing work to life on paper.<br><br>
                    Square Wheel Press is currently accepting submissions for its second anthology edition. Prospective authors should visit Square Wheel Press' website for further information on the theme and submission guidelines.
